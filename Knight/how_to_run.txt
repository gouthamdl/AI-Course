- Type the following command in the same directory as the code
	
	python AStarSearch.py x y
	
	Note x and y are integer values that have to be entered. They represent the x and y co-ordinates of the goal cell respectively.
	
	For eg:
	python AStarSearch.py 4 5
	This will generate the solution to go from (0,0) to (4,5)
	
- I used Python 2.7.3 for implementing this problem.
